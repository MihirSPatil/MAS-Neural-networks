1. What is the difference between competitive learning and Hebbian learning?
R. For the Hebbian learning approach several output neurons could be active simultaneously, while for the competitive learning only a single output neuron is active. 

2. What is the disadvantage of using unsupervised learning?
R. The amount of training data that is required. 

3. What is the sequence of events during the learning process? 
R. 1. The NN is stimulated by an enviroment
   2. The parameters of the NN are changed based on a stimulation
   3. The NN responds in a new way to the environment because of the changes in the internal structure.
