implement the neural image captioning model (NIC) as described previously in the lectures for the the IAPR TC-12 dataset.

Dataset can be found here: https://www.imageclef.org/photodata

Original paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555

EVALUATION:

- Data manager class  for loading dataset.

- The dataset to be loaded should be a dictionary including as keys the image path and as respective values the description of that image (this alleviates the memory resources).

- Generator class that takes the data dictionary constructed by the data manager class. This class generates batches for the network.

- NIC model.

- Display of training loss and training accuracy.

- Display descriptions generated by the validation/test images.

- Display of random images taken from the internet. 

TIPS:

- REUSE your code from the previous exercise that included generation of text. 

- Base your data manager solution from: https://github.com/oarriaga/neural_image_captioning

- Give proper credit when using explicitly code of others.

- I suggest you having already the data_manager, data_generator  already constructed by next Monday.
